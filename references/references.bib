   abstract = {Meteorological data (1993 to 2004) from 2 public weather stations in Phoenix, Arizona, and Athens, Georgia, were analyzed with test day milk yield data from herds near weather stations to identify the most appropriate temperature-humidity index (THI) to measure losses in milk production due to heat stress in the semiarid climate of Arizona and the humid climate of Georgia. Seven THI with different weightings of dry bulb temperature and humidity were compared. Testday data were analyzed using 2 models to determine threshold of heat stress and rate of decline of milk production associated with a specific THI. Differences in thresholds of heat stress were found among indices and between regions. Indices with higher weights on humidity were best in the humid climate, whereas indices with larger weights on temperature were the best indicators of heat stress in the semiarid climate. Humidity was the limiting factor of heat stress in humid climates, whereas dry bulb temperature was the limiting factor of heat stress in dry climates. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007.},

   abstract = {Cooling during the entire dry period abates the negative effects of heat stress postpartum, yet the temporal relationship of cooling (i.e., early or late dry period) to performance is unknown. We evaluated the effect of heat stress early, late, and for the entire dry period on subsequent performance. Cows were selected based on mature-equivalent milk yield and dried off 45 d before expected calving. Cows were blocked by parity, previous 305-d mature equivalent milk yield, and body weight (BW) and randomly assigned to cooling (shade, fans, and soakers; CL) or heat stress (shade; HT). Treatments included CL (n = 20) or HT (n = 18) during the entire dry period, HT during the first 3 wk dry and then CL until calving (HTCL, n = 21), or CL during the first 3 wk dry period and then HT until calving (CLHT, n = 19). Heat stress increased rectal temperature (RT; CL, 38.8; HT, 39.1 ± 0.04°C) and respiration rate (RR; CL, 52.9; HT, 70.5 ± 1.9 breaths/min) during the early dry period. In the late dry period, HT increased RT and RR relative to CL cows (RT = CL, 38.7; HT, 39.1; CLHT, 39.1; HTCL, 38.9 ± 0.05°C; RR = CL, 47; HT, 64; CLHT, 66; HTCL, 53 ± 2.1 breaths/min). During the early dry period, HT decreased dry matter intake (CL, 11.8; HT, 10.5 ± 0.35 kg/d) but dry matter intake did not differ among treatments during late dry period (HT, 10.7; HTCL, 11.1; CL, 11.2; CLHT, 10.1 ± 0.55 kg/d). Cows exposed to prepartum cooling during the entire dry period had increased dry matter intake compared with cows exposed to heat stress during the late dry period (CL vs. CLHT, 11.2 ± 0.55 and 10.1 ± 0.55 kg/d, respectively). Heat stress at any time reduced gestation length compared with cows under prepartum cooling during the entire dry period (CL, 277 vs. HT, 274; CLHT, 273; and HTCL, 274 ± 1.17 d). Dry period length decreased by approximately 4 d if cows were exposed to HT at any time. During the early dry period, HT decreased BW, whereas CL increased BW relative to that at dry-off (CL, 6.9; HT, −9.4 ± 3.7 kg). In the late dry period, we detected no differences in BW gain among treatments, but cows exposed to prepartum cooling for the entire dry period tended to have increased BW gain compared with HT and HTCL. Prepartum cooling during the early or late dry period alone partially rescued milk yield only in the first 3 wk of lactation (CL, 32.9; HT, 26.6; CLHT, 29.7; HTCL, 30.7 ± 1.37 kg/d). Cooling for the entire dry period increased milk yield up to 30 wk into lactation compared with all other treatments. Thus, HT at any time during the dry period compromises performance of cows after calving.},

A sample of German dairy farms reveals that animal health and heat stress indicators influence mean and semi-variance of revenues. For instance, heat stress exposure reduces expected milk revenues significantly. In the case of animal health-related indicators, our results show trade-offs between expected revenues and downside risks. Furthermore, variabilities in revenues from milk and animal sales are significantly interrelated.},

   abstract = {In the United States, climate change is likely to increase average daily temperatures and the frequency of heat waves, which can reduce meat and milk production in animals. Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress - including modifications to animal management or housing - tend to increase production costs. We use operation-level economic data coupled with finely-scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects the technical efficiency of dairies across the United States. We then use this information to estimate the possible decline in milk production in 2030 resulting from climate change-induced heat stress under the simplifying assumptions that the production technology, location of production, and other factors are held constant. For four climate model scenarios, the results indicate modest heat-stress-related production declines by 2030, with the largest declines occurring in the southern states. © The Author (2014).},

   abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid in the economics literature to the effects of meteorological conditions on milk production. Meteorological variables can be expected to affect milk production through their impact on the productivity of cows and the production of foodstuff. Rather than including meteorological variables as inputs in the milk production process, we propose a production function where these variables affect the productivity of cows and the production of forage, thereby indirectly affecting milk production. Using production and meteorological data from the Spanish region of Asturias corresponding to 383 dairy farms observed during a six-year period from 2006 to 2011, the results from our estimated production function show that meteorological variables have a significant impact on milk production. We find that milk production is higher under warm weather conditions due to improvements in forage production.},

Herein, we review the effects of high temperature and humidity on body temperature, feed intake, milk production, follicle development, estrous behavior, and pregnancy in dairy cows. Analyses of the effects of THI on dairy production have shown that body temperature is an important physiological parameter in the evaluation of the health state of dairy cows. Although THI is an important environmental index and can help to infer the degree of heat stress, it does not reflect the physiological changes experienced by dairy cows undergoing heat stress. How­ever, the simultaneous measurement of THI and physiological indexes (e.g., body temperature) would be very useful for improving dairy production. The successful development of automatic detection techniques makes it possible to combine THI with other physiological indexes (i.e., body temperature and activity), which could help us to comprehensively evaluate heat stress in dairy cows and provide important technical support to effectively prevent heat stress.},

abstract = {Abstract Assessing the effects of weather and climate on agricultural production is crucial for designing policies related to climate change adaptation and mitigation. A large body of literature has identified the detrimental effects of climate change on crop yields worldwide, and farm-level adaptation has been shown to mitigate the adverse effects on agricultural production. In this study, we employ a structural model to examine farm production responses to ongoing weather trends. We investigate how farmers adjust output and input decisions by estimating a system of output supply and input demand functions, controlling for nonrandom crop selection. Using panel data with 14,796 observations reflecting 1638 German crop farms (1996–2019), we find that both the expected and realized weather determine farmers' production decisions. In the event of a drought, the supply of most considered crops and the demand for fertilizer decrease. The drought shock has also lasting effects on farmers' production decisions, with a reduced supply of protein crops and an increased level of root crops production in subsequent years. These findings highlight the need to account for farm-level production responses when assessing weather and climate impacts.},

abstract = {Summary Correlations between acetone in milk and milk production during the first nine weeks postpartum were calculated in ten individual cows and for a whole herd. The decrease in milk production due to ke***tonaemia was evaluated using a mathematical model of the KaleidaGraph™ intergrate area program. For determination of milk components, a milk sample was obtained twice a week from one to nine weeks postpartum. Milk yield was negatively correlated with acetone concentration in milk. In non-clinical ketotic cows the calculated loss of milk yield due to elevation of milk acetone was 2–9\% and in clinical ketotic cow it was as high as 26\%. The correlation between milk components and acetone level varied at different stages of ketosis. Thus the stage of lactation and of ketosis should be taken into consideration when the correlation between milk parameters and milk production is evaluated. Prior to clinical ketosis, milk acetone was negatively correlated with milk yield, percentage of protein and percentage of lactose, whereas it was positively correlated with percentage of fat and urea concentration. In addition, high levels of acetone tended to be associated with high cell count. It is concluded that 1) ketotic cows do not achieve the maximum potential milk yield and 2) high levels of milk acetone are harmful to the udder. For high milk production, the concentration of acetone in milk should not exceed 0.05 mmol/l at any stage of lactation.},
