	abstract = {In this study, the contribution of management practices, herd characteristics, and seasonal variables to the herd somatic cell count (SCC) was quantified in herds with low ({\textless}150,000 cells/mL), medium (150,000–200,000 cells/mL), and high ({\textgreater}200,000 cells/mL) herd SCC (HSCC). Selection of the variables was performed using a linear mixed effect model; HSCC was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the individual cow's SCC. The data concerning management practices were derived from 3 questionnaires on mastitis prevention and management practices on 246 Dutch dairy farms. The monthly Dairy Herd Improvement test data of these 246 farms were used to calculate the herd characteristics and seasonal effects. None of the management practices were associated with HSCC in all 3 HSCC categories. Some variables only had a significant association with HSCC in one HSCC category, such as dry premilking treatment (−9,100 cells/mL in the low HSCC category) or feeding calves with high SCC milk (11,100 cells/mL in the medium HSCC category). Others had an opposite effect on HSCC in different HSCC categories, such as average parity (−6,400 and 11,000 cells/mL in the low and medium HSCC category, respectively) and feeding calves with fresh milk (10,300 and −9,700 cells/mL in the low and high HSCC category, respectively). We conclude that, given the individual Dairy Herd Improvement data and information on management practices of an individual farm, it is possible to provide quantitative insight into the contribution of these different variables to the HSCC of an individual farm. Being able to provide such insight is a prerequisite for interpretation, prediction, and control of HSCC on individual dairy farms.},

	abstract = {Corrected milk equations were developed in attempts to bring milk weights to a standardized basis for comparison by expressing the weight and composition of milk as corrected to the energy content of milk of a specific composition. Expressed as milk weights familiar on farm and in commerce, this approach integrates energy contributions of the dissimilar components to make the mass units more comparable. Such values are applied in evaluating feed efficiency, lactation performance, and global milk production, as functional units for lifecycle assessments, and in translation of research results. Corrected milk equations are derived from equations relating milk gross energy to milk composition. First, a milk energy equation is used to calculate the energy value of the milk composition to correct to (e.g., 0.695 Mcal/kg for milk with 3.5\% fat, 3.05\% true protein, and 4.85\% lactose). That energy value is divided into the energy equation to give the corrected milk equation. Confusion has arisen, as different equations purport to correct to the same milk composition; their differences are based on uses of different energy equations or divisors. Accuracy of corrected milk equations depends on the accuracy of the energy equations used to create them. Energy equations have evolved over time as different milk component analyses have become more available. Inclusion of multiple milk components more accurately predicts milk energy content than does fat content alone. Omission of components from an equation requires the assumption that their content in milk is constant or highly correlated with an included component. Neither of these assumptions is true. Milk energy equations evaluated on a small data set of measured milk values have demonstrated that equations that incorporate protein, fat, and lactose contents multiplied by the gross energy of each component more closely predict milk energy than equations containing fewer components or regression-derived equations. This provides a tentative recommendation for using energy equations that include the 3 main milk components and their gross energy multipliers for predicting milk energy and deriving corrected milk equations. Accuracy of energy equations is affected by the accuracy of gross energy values of individual components and variability of milk composition. Lactose has consistent reported gross energy values. In contrast, gross energy of milk fat and protein vary as their compositional profiles change. Future refinements could assess accuracy of milk fat and protein gross energy and whether that appreciably improves milk energy predictions. Fat gross energy has potential to be calculated using the milk fatty acid profile, although the influence on gross energy may be small. For research, direct reporting of milk energy values, rather than corrected milk, provides the most explicit, least manipulated form of the data. However, provision of corrected milk values in addition to information on components can serve to translate the energy information to a form familiar to and widely used in the field. When reporting corrected milk data, the corrected milk equation, citation for the energy equation used, and composition and energy contents of the corrected milk must be described to make clear what the values represent.},

	abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

	abstract = {Tropical and sub-tropical climates are characterized by high temperature and humidity, during at least part of the year. Consequently, heat stress is common in Holstein cattle and productive and reproductive losses are frequent. Our objectives were as follows: (1) to quantify losses in production and quality of milk due to heat stress; (2) to estimate genetic correlations within and between milk yield (MY) and milk quality traits; and (3) to evaluate the trends of genetic components of tolerance to heat stress in multiple lactations of Brazilian Holstein cows. Thus, nine analyses using two-trait random regression animal models were carried out to estimate variance components and genetic parameters over temperature–humidity index (THI) values for MY and milk quality traits (three lactations: MY×fat percentage (F\%), MY×protein percentage (P\%) and MY×somatic cell score (SCS)) of Brazilian Holstein cattle. It was demonstrated that the effects of heat stress can be harmful for traits related to milk production and milk quality of Holstein cattle even though most herds were maintained in a modified environment, for example, with fans and sprinklers. For MY, the effect of heat stress was more detrimental in advanced lactations (−0.22 to −0.52 kg/day per increase of 1 THI unit). In general, the mean heritability estimates were higher for lower THI values and longer days in milk for all traits. In contrast, the heritability estimates for SCS increased with increasing THI values in the second and third lactation. For each trait studied, lower genetic correlations (different from unity) were observed between opposite extremes of THI (THI 47 v. THI 80) and in advanced lactations. The genetic correlations between MY and milk quality trait varied across the THI scale and lactations. The genotype×environment interaction due to heat stress was more important for MY and SCS, particularly in advanced lactations, and can affect the genetic relationship between MY and milk quality traits. Selection for higher MY, F\% or P\% may result in a poor response of the animals to heat stress, as a genetic antagonism was observed between the general production level and specific ability to respond to heat stress for these traits. Genetic trends confirm the adverse responses in the genetic components of heat stress over the years for milk production and quality. Consequently, the selection of Holstein cattle raised in modified environments in both tropical and sub-tropical regions should take into consideration the genetic variation in heat stress.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12711-023-00779-1},
	abstract = {Background
Heat stress negatively influences cattle welfare, health and productivity. To cope with the forecasted increases in temperature and heat waves frequency, identifying high-producing animals that are tolerant to heat is of capital importance to maintain milk production. This study, based on the joint analysis of on-farm performance and weather data, had two objectives: (1) to determine the response in production performances (milk, fat and protein yields, fat and protein contents) and udder health (somatic cell score) to temperature-humidity index (THI) variations in Montbeliarde cows, and (2) to estimate the interactions between genotype and THI, to enable the identification of the most adapted animals for facing the expected increases in temperature.

Results
Test-day records from first and second lactations from 2016 to 2020 were associated with the average THI during the three days before the test-day record. In total, 446,717 test-day records from 55,650 cows in first lactation and 457,516 test-day records from 58,229 cows in second lactation were analysed. The optimal THI was below 55 (i.e. {\textasciitilde} 12–13 °C) for all traits. Individual responses to THI were estimated by random regression models, which also included individual responses to days in milk. Regardless of the stage of lactation, genetic correlations along the THI gradient were above 0.80, which suggests that genotype-by-THI interactions were weak for production and udder health traits. Nevertheless, a variability in the individual slope of decay could be highlighted at high THI. The genetic correlation between production level at moderate THI and the slope at high THI was negative, while for somatic cell score, it was positive, indicating that heat stress amplifies the susceptibility to mastitis.

Conclusions
The optimal THI for French Montbeliarde cows is below 55 for production and udder health traits. Genetic-by-THI interactions are weak in French Montbeliarde cows for production and udder health traits, but not all animals react in the same way to high temperatures. Even if there is little room for improvement, using a heat tolerance index in cattle selection would be relevant to anticipate the expected increases in temperature. Further investigations are needed to interpret this variability on production traits. However, the current selection for mastitis resistance seems appropriate to adapt cattle to rising temperatures.},

	abstract = {In spatial regression models, collinearity between covariates and spatial effects can lead to significant bias in effect estimates. This problem, known as spatial confounding, is encountered modelling forestry data to assess the effect of temperature on tree health. Reliable inference is difficult as results depend on whether or not spatial effects are included in the model. The mechanism behind spatial confounding is poorly understood and methods for dealing with it are limited. We propose a novel approach, spatial+, in which collinearity is reduced by replacing the covariates in the spatial model by their residuals after spatial dependence has been regressed away. Using a thin plate spline model formulation, we recognise spatial confounding as a smoothing-induced bias identified by Rice (1986), and through asymptotic analysis of the effect estimates, we show that spatial+ avoids the bias problems of the spatial model. This is also demonstrated in a simulation study. Spatial+ is straight-forward to implement using existing software and, as the response variable is the same as that of the spatial model, standard model selection criteria can be used for comparisons. A major advantage of the method is also that it extends to models with non-Gaussian response distributions. Finally, while our results are derived in a thin plate spline setting, the spatial+ methodology transfers easily to other spatial model formulations.},

Based on farm accounting data from Greek dairy farms for the 2004–2017 period, the main technical and financial indicators are estimated and compared to provide a clear picture of the structural adjustment of the dairy cow sector during the last two decades. The outcomes and the implications described herein are relevant for specialized dairy farms in most European countries. The results indicate that modern farms breed a larger number of cows, achieve a higher milk yield, rely on high compound feed intakes and operate under an intensive pattern. This trend is even more evident in larger farms with an entrepreneurial nature, whose structural adjustments occurred in a more concise and effective manner. The latter benefited from a downward shift in their long-term average cost curves and the resulting economies of scale, achieving reasonable gross margins despite the ever-increasing feeding costs. Nowadays, the European dairy cow sector faces major economic, social and environmental challenges that must be properly addressed to secure its survival. The findings of this study provide insights concerning the efficient financial management of dairy farms that can support the development of strategies and policy recommendations that will enhance the resilience and sustainability of the sector.},

	abstract = {Heat stress is a significant challenge in dairy farming systems. Dairy cows under heat stress will encounter impaired welfare leading to production losses. As the frequency and magnitude of heat stress events increase in the coming decades, a focus on heat stress reduction studies becomes important. Modelling and on-farm experiments have been used to assess the effects of heat stress on livestock over the last few decades. Mitigation solutions including optimal shed structure, ventilation, feeding regimes, farm management and genetic selection have all been explored. However, under different farm conditions, the heat tolerance and coping ability of dairy cows can vary significantly. Until now, the results from different mathematical models have provided a variety of heat stress thresholds for on-farm use. In practice, it is still costly to determine an accurate heat stress level in order to identify the mitigation requirements. This review summarises previous studies on the effects of heat stress on intensively reared dairy cows and different mitigation approaches. We have undertaken a comparative analysis of thermal indices, animal responses, and mitigation approaches. Recommendations are then given for developing a framework to enhance the measurement, assessment and mitigation of heat stress. Robust monitoring systems, big data analyses and artificial intelligence algorithms are needed for the future development of dynamic, self-calibrating model-based systems, which could provide real-time assessment and minimisation of heat stress.},

	abstract = {The effects of high ambient temperatures on production animals, once thought to be limited to tropical areas, has extended into northern latitudes in response to the increasing global temperature. The number of days where the temperature-humidity index (THI) exceeds the comfort threshold ({\textgreater}72) is increasing in the northern United States, Canada, and Europe. Compounded by the increasing number of dairy animals and the intensification of production, heat stress has become one of the most important challenges facing the dairy industry today. The objectives of this review were to present an overview of the effects of heat stress on dairy cattle welfare and highlight important research gaps in the literature. We will also briefly discuss current heat abatement strategies, as well as the sustainability of future heat stress management. Heat stress has negative effects on the health and biological functioning of dairy cows through depressed milk production and reduced reproductive performance. Heat stress can also compromise the affective state of dairy cows by inducing feelings of hunger and thirst, and we have highlighted the need for research efforts to examine the potential relationship between heat stress, frustration, aggression, and pain. Little work has examined how heat stress affects an animal's natural coping behaviors, as well as how the animal's evolutionary adaptations for thermoregulation are managed in modern dairy systems. More research is needed to identify improved comprehensive cow-side measurements that can indicate real-time responses to elevated ambient temperatures and that could be incorporated into heat abatement management decisions.},

	abstract = {For dairy cattle on pasture in temperate regions, it is largely unknown to what degree hot summer conditions impact energy metabolism, milk yield and milk composition and how effective shade is in reducing these negative effects. During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80\% reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for S cows than for NS cows (by 0.02°C and 0.03°C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl−), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for S cows. The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between S and NS cows. For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For S cows, the milk yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on milk protein content was remediated by shade. In conclusion, access to shade tempered the negative effects of high HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and a blood plasma indicator of changing energy metabolism (generally) as well as prevented the decrease in milk yield observed in cows without access to shade.},

	abstract = {Even in temperate climate regions, an increase in ambient temperature and exposure to solar radiation can cause heat stress in lactating dairy cows. We hypothesised that grazing dairy cows exhibit short-term physiological changes due to increasing heat load under moderate climate conditions. Over two consecutive summers, 38 lactating Holstein dairy cows were studied in a full-time grazing system. Data were collected in 10 experimental periods of up to three consecutive days with a moderate comprehensive climate index (CCI). The individual animals’ vaginal temperature (VT), heart rate, and locomotor activity data were automatically monitored with sensors. Blood samples and proportional whole milk samples were collected at afternoon milking. The concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, urea nitrogen, plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine were analysed in blood plasma, and fat, protein, lactose, urea nitrogen, cortisol, Na+, K+, and Cl− concentrations were analysed in milk. The daily distribution of VT recordings greater than 39 °C showed a circadian rhythm with a proportion of recordings of 2\% and lower during the night and a percentage of 10\% or higher in the afternoon. The cows’ maximal daily vaginal temperature (VTMAX) between 0830 and 1430 h was positively related to the mean daily CCI in the same time period (CCIMEAN; mean and SD 23.6 ± 5.4 °C). Cows with greater VTMAX had an increased mean heart rate, plasma glucose and milk cortisol concentrations and decreased concentrations of plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The concentration of Na+ in milk was lower, and the concentration of K+ in milk tended to be higher in cows with increased VTMAX. For beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids and urea nitrogen concentrations in plasma and fat and lactose concentrations in milk no relationships were found in terms of increasing VT. For milk urea nitrogen and protein concentrations, the proportion of total variance explained by inter-individual or -period variance was high. In conclusion, changes observed in milk and blood likely reflected short-term physiological responses to moderate heat stress. In particular, milk cortisol and Na+ may be useful traits for timely monitoring of heat stress in individual cows because their inter-individual variances were relatively small and samples can be collected non-invasively.},

Supernodes merge and split apart during an update/downdate. Dynamic supernodes are introduced which allow a sparse Cholesky update/downdate to obtain performance competitive with conventional supernodal methods. A dynamic supernodal solver is shown to exceed the performance of the conventional (BLAS-based) supernodal method for solving triangular systems.

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface's similarity to lme4.},

            We consider an application in electricity grid load prediction, where generalized additive models are appropriate, but where the data set's size can make their use practically intractable with existing methods. We therefore develop practical generalized additive model fitting methods for large data sets in the case in which the smooth terms in the model are represented by using penalized regression splines. The methods use iterative update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling problems.},

The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and while firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practical application of the methodology.

Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress — including modifications to animal management or housing — tend to increase production costs and capital expenditures. Dairy cows are particularly sensitive to heat stress, and the dairy sector has been estimated to bear over half of the costs of current heat stress to the livestock industry. In this report, we use operation-level economic data coupled with finely scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects U.S. dairies’ effectiveness at producing outputs with a given level of inputs. We use this information to estimate the potential decline in milk production in 2030 resulting from climate change-induced heat stress. For four climate model scenarios, the results indicate modest heat stress-related production declines over the next 20 years, with the largest declines occurring in the South.},

	abstract = {Upper limit of thermal stability and subsequent rise of thermoregulatory functions are affected by body temperature. This study was designed to determine the effects of rectal temperature (RT) on dairy cows’ performance (heart rates (HR), respiratory rates (RR), milk yield (MY), dry matter intake (DMI), digestibility, plasma concentration of vitamin C under hot climate. This study was carried out in 2009, in north-west of Tunisia using 30 Holstein cows in mid lactation. The experiment was performed in spring (15th of February-15th of March: P1) and summer (1st-30th of August: P2). On each test day, temperature-humidity index (THI), RT, HR, RR, MY, DMI, digestibility and plasma VC concentration were determined. All this parameters were affected (P {\textless} 0.001) when the THI increased from 65.62 (P1) to 83.27 (P2). Regression analyses were carried out between THI index and some parameters (HR, RR, MY, DMI, digestibility, plasma concentration of vitamin C) and between RT and same parameters (HR, RR, MY, DMI, digestibility, plasma concentration of vitamin C). Characteristics of regression analyses in the two modes were different as also were R2 and r (correlation coefficient) of the regressions. R2 in regressions on RT (R2 (RT, DMI) = 0.92 (P {\textless} 0.01); R2 (RT, MY) = 0.91 (P {\textless} 0.001)) was markedly higher relative to R2 in regressions on THI (R2 (THI, DMI) = 0.76 (P {\textless} 0.001); R2 (THI, MY) = 0.63 (P {\textless} 0.001)). The two regressions modes suggest that increasing R2 in regressions on RT confirms that rectal temperature constitutes a larger component of total variance of responses in dairy cows to hot environmental temperature.},

	abstract = {Fixed-eﬀect models are widely used econometric methods. This paper presents the R package FENmlm which is devoted to the estimation of maximum likelihood (ML) models with any number of ﬁxed-eﬀects. The core of the algorithm, detailed in the paper, is based on a general framework to estimate any ML model with multiple ﬁxedeﬀects. It also integrates a ﬁxed-point acceleration method to hasten the convergence of the ﬁxed-eﬀect coeﬃcients. The R function oﬀers the user a simple way to estimate any of four diﬀerent maximum likelihood models: Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gaussian and Logit. Illustrations with real data detail the estimation process as well as the clustering of standard-errors and the various tools to export and manage results from multiple estimations. Simulations show that the algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of computing time (often by orders of magnitude) or, in the Gaussian case, is on a par with the most eﬃcient ones. Most interestingly, apart from the Gaussian case, the algorithm is revealed to be the only able to estimate models with many ﬁxed-eﬀects on a simple laptop. FENmlm is a free software and distributed under the general public license, as part of the R software project.},

	title = {When {Should} {You} {Adjust} {Standard} {Errors} for {Clustering}?},
	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

	abstract = {Automatic milking systems (AMS), or milking robots, are becoming widely accepted as a milking technology that reduces labour and increases milk yield. However, reported amount of labour saved, changes in milk yield, and milk quality when transitioning to AMS vary widely. The purpose of this study was to document the impact of adopting AMS on farms with regards to reported changes in milking labour management, milk production, milk quality, and participation in dairy herd improvement (DHI) programmes. A survey was conducted across Canada over the phone, online, and in-person. In total, 530 AMS farms were contacted between May 2014 and the end of June 2015. A total of 217 AMS producers participated in the General Survey (Part 1), resulting in a 41\% response rate, and 69 of the respondents completed the more detailed follow-up questions (Part 2). On average, after adopting AMS, the number of employees (full- and part-time non-family labour combined) decreased from 2.5 to 2.0, whereas time devoted to milking-related activities decreased by 62\% (from 5.2 to 2.0 h/day). Median milking frequency was 3.0 milkings/day and robots were occupied on average 77\% of the day. Producers went to fetch cows a median of 2 times/day, with a median of 3 fetch cows or 4\% of the herd per robot/day. Farms had a median of 2.5 failed or incomplete milkings/robot per day. Producers reported an increase in milk yield, but little effect on milk quality. Mean milk yield on AMS farms was 32.6 kg/cow day. Median bulk tank somatic cell count was 180 000 cells/ml. Median milk fat on AMS farms was 4.0\% and median milk protein was 3.3\%. At the time of the survey, 67\% of producers were current participants of a DHI programme. Half of the producers who were not DHI participants had stopped participation after adopting AMS. Overall, this study characterized impacts of adopting AMS and may be a useful guide for making this transition.},

Objectives were to evaluate differences in body temperature regulation during heat stress between Holstein, Brown Swiss, and crossbred cows under semi-tropical conditions and test whether the seasonal depression in milk yield was greater for genetic groups less able to regulate body temperature. For the first objective, conducted during heat stress, vaginal temperature was measured at 15-min intervals for 5 d in 133 pregnant lactating cows. Vaginal temperatures were affected by time and interaction between genetic group and time. Vaginal temperatures were higher for Holsteins for most times of the day. Moreover, the maximum daily vaginal temperature was higher for Holstein (39.8 ± 0.1°C) than for Brown Swiss (39.3 ± 0.2°C) or crossbreds (39.2 ± 0.1°C). For the second objective, 6,179 lactation records from 2,976 cows were analyzed to determine effects of genetic group and season of calving (cool season = Oct to March; warm season = April to Sept) on 305-d milk yield. Milk yield was affected by genetic group and season but not by the interaction of genetic group and season. The difference in average 305-d milk yield between cows calving in cool versus hot weather was 310 kg (4\% decrease) for Holstein, 480 kg (7\% decrease) for Brown Swiss, and 420 kg (6\% decrease) for crossbreds. In conclusion, Brown Swiss and crossbreds regulated body temperature during heat stress better than Holsteins but these breeds were not more resistant to heat stress with respect to milk yield. Thus, genetic differences in thermotolerance are likely to exist that are independent of regulation of body temperature.},

              Heat stress (HS) damages the global dairy industry by reducing milk yields and quality, harming health, and damaging the reproduction of dairy cows, causing huge economic losses each year. However, an understanding of the physiological mechanism of HS lactating dairy cows remains elusive. Here, a metabolomics study using LC-MS and

              H NMR spectroscopy was performed to analyze the metabolomic differences in the milk between HS-free and HS dairy cows, and discover diagnostic biomarkers and changes in the metabolic pathway. A total of 53 discriminating metabolites were significantly up- or down-regulated in the HS group compared with the HS-free group (

               {\textless} 0.05). These biomarkers were involved in pathways of carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, and gut microbiome-derived metabolism. Comparing these potential biomarkers with previously identified HS candidate biomarkers in plasma, significant correlations between the levels of lactate, pyruvate, creatine, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethylamine, oleic acid, linoleic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, and phosphatidylcholine 42:2 in milk and plasma were found, indicating that the blood-milk barrier became leaky and the levels of these 10 biomarkers in milk can reflect HS-induced metabolomic alterations in blood. These novel findings can support more in-depth research to elucidate the milk-based changes in metabolic pathways in HS lactating dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Heat stress (HS) decreases milk protein synthesis beyond what would be expected based on the concomitant reduction in feed intake. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the direct effects of HS on milk protein production. Four multiparous, lactating Holstein cows (101 ± 10 d in milk, 574 ± 36 kg of body weight, 38 ± 2 kg of milk/d) were individually housed in environmental chambers and randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups in a crossover design. The study was divided into 2 periods with 2 identical experimental phases (control phase and trial phase) within each period. During phase 1 or control phase (9 d), all cows were housed in thermal neutral conditions (TN; 20°C, 55\% humidity) and fed ad libitum. During phase 2 or treatment phase (9 d), group 1 was exposed to cyclical HS conditions (32 to 36°C, 40\% humidity) and fed ad libitum, whereas group 2 remained in TN conditions but was pair-fed (PFTN) to their HS counterparts to eliminate the confounding effects of dissimilar feed intake. After a 30-d washout period in TN conditions, the study was repeated (period 2), inverting the environmental treatments of the groups relative to period 1: group 2 was exposed to HS and group 1 to PFTN conditions. Compared with PFTN conditions, HS decreased milk yield (17.0\%), milk protein (4.1\%), milk protein yield (19\%), 4\% fat-corrected milk (23\%), and fat yield (19\%). Apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, crude protein, and ether extract was increased (11.1–42.9\%) in HS cows, as well as rumen liquor ammonia (before feeding 33.2\%; after feeding 29.5\%) and volatile fatty acid concentration (45.3\%) before feeding. In addition, ruminal pH was reduced (9.5 and 6\% before and after feeding, respectively) during HS. Heat stress decreased plasma free amino acids (AA; 17.1\%) and tended to increase and increased blood, urine, and milk urea nitrogen (17.2, 243, and 24.5\%, respectively).},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that there exists a lag relationship between daily milk yield and heat stress. The values of heat stress indicators (e.g., temperaturehumidity index and ambient temperature) before test day have a simple correlation with daily milk yield on test day. However, the simple correlation might not be the best description because daily milk yield and heat stress indicators have a nature of time series in common, and their correlations are cross correlations that could be affected by autocorrelations. We hope to give a more reliable estimation on the lag relationship of daily milk yield via excluding autocorrelations with transfer function modeling. In this study, we found a lag relationship between daily milk yield and heat stress indicators based on transfer function modeling. Heat stress indicators included ambient temperature and temperature-humidity index. The daily milk yield data from 123 cows were obtained during a consecutive 63-d period (July 10–September 10, 2016). The mean daily milk yield (MY) and the maximum daily ambient temperature (TA\_max) satisfied the stationary hypothesis, and the cross correlation between them was calculated. Before excluding autocorrelation, MY at 0 to 4 d after test day had significant cross correlations with TA\_max on test day. After excluding the influence of autocorrelations, MY at 1 to 3 d after the test day had significant cross correlations with TA\_max on test day. This result suggested that MY would respond to TA\_max 1 d after the test day. In addition, the strength of cross correlations between MY and TA\_max decreased from 1 to 3 d in sequence, implying a declining lag response of MY that would last for 3 d. The transfer function model for MY and TA\_max is written as: MYt = 16.90 + 0.74MYt − 1 − 0.25TA\_maxt − 1 + Nt, where Nt is white noise. This model can be used to track and predict the dynamic response of MY to TA\_max.},

Measures of correlation and agreement demonstrated that climate conditions differ significantly between the barn and the corresponding official meteorological stations as well as between 4 different locations inside 1 barn. The ambient temperature was higher (6.4 ± 3.6°C) in the barn than at the official meteorological station. The relative humidity was higher at the official meteorological station (0.2 ± 7.2\%) than in the barn. The THI was higher (11.1 ± 6.5) in the barn than at the official meteorological station. Days with an average THI ≥ 72 were 64 and 4 out of 756 experimental d in the barn and at the official meteorological station, respectively. Also, in a comparison of 7 different barns, ambient temperature and THI were significantly higher than at the closest corresponding official meteorological station.

To learn more about the potential effects of climate change on dairying in Hawaii, we conducted a study on site-specific climate characterization using several variables including rainfall, wind speed (WS), solar radiation, and temperature, at two dairy farms located on Hawai`i Island, Hawai`i, in Ookala named “OK DAIRY” and in Upolu Point named “UP DAIRY.” Temperature–humidity index (THI) and WS variations in the hottest four months (June to September) were analyzed to determine when critical thresholds that affect animal health are exceeded. Rainfall data were used to estimate the capacity of forage production in 6-mo wet (November to April) and dry (May to October) seasons. Future projections of temperature and rainfall were assessed using mid- and end-century gridded data products for low (RCP 4.5) and high emissions (RCP 8.5) scenarios. Our results showed that the “OK DAIRY” site received higher rainfall than the “UP DAIRY” site, favoring grass growth and forage availability. In addition, the “UP DAIRY” site was more stressful for animals during the summer (THI 69 to 73) than the “OK DAIRY” site (THI 67 to 70) as the THI exceeded the critical threshold of 68, which is conducive for high-lactating cattle. On the “UP DAIRY” site, the THI did not drop below 68 during the summer nights, which created fewer opportunities for cattle to recover from heat stress. Future projections indicated that air temperature would increase 1.3 to 1.8 °C by mid-century and 1.6 to 3.2 °C by the end-century at both farms, and rainfall will increase at the “OK DAIRY” site and decrease at the “UP DAIRY” site by the end-century. The agriculture and livestock industries, particularly the dairy and beef subsectors in Hawai`i, are vulnerable to climate changes as higher temperatures and less rainfall will have adverse effects on cattle. The findings in this study demonstrated how both observed and projected changes in climate support the development of long-term strategies for breeding and holistic livestock management practices to adapt to changing climate conditions.},

The major factor affecting SCC at the herd and individual cow level is the presence of intramammary infections or inflammation in the mammary gland.

We collected data from 23 weather stations and 14,424 milk test-days for milk yield and milk fat and protein content for the period July 2011 to June 2013. As an indicator of heat stress, we used the maximum daily temperature–humidity index (THI) from 2 days before the milk test date. We fitted the data using hierarchical regression models stratified by farm, cow parity and monthly testday milk records. The effect of THI was deemed low on biological costs through milk yield. However, the known negative relationship between milk yield and milk quality (protein and fat content) became even steeper when the THI increased, suggesting a significant negative correlation between heat stress and milk quality. Therefore, although the milk yield of cows in the organic farming systems analyzed appeared resilient to heat stress conditions, milk quality, a major selling point for organic dairy products, was negatively affected. The model presented here could be used to predict the potential impacts of different climate change scenarios on dairy farming, and to delineate adaptation strategies within organic systems.},

	abstract = {The United States produces 41\% of the world's corn and 38\% of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

This payment for each kilogram of raw milk processed into cheese is issued to milk producers through dairy processors. In the ex post evaluation, by applying a vector autoregressive model, we estimate the effects of reductions of the payment for prices of raw milk used to produce Emmentaler, Gruye`re, and industrial cheese. Past declines in the payment have only been partially transmitted to raw milk prices. The rate of transmission is higher for milk used for the production of industrial cheese than for artisan cheeses. In the ex ante impact evaluation, we use a partial equilibrium model and develop a counterfactual scenario in which the payment is removed. The payment for milk processed into cheese is found to have effects on cheese production and exports but also has important indirect effects on other dairy products. Our ﬁndings suggest that about two-thirds of the payment are beneﬁting milk producers. At the same time, the overall welfare losses resulting from the elimination of the aid are smaller than the budget allocated to this measure, suggesting a net welfare gain from elimination.},

This book illustrates how urban societies both exploited and supported farmers, and together endured economic and environmental crises. Viewing farmers as the crucial interface between civilization and the natural world, Mark Tauger examines the environmental changes, political and social transformations, and scientific and technological developments in farming. The second edition draws attention to the modern period, particularly the effects of war, depression, and authoritarianism on world agriculture, scientific advances and the problems they created, increased international competition between countries with the expanding role of corporations, the threats posed by climate change, and future prospects. Accessibly written and following a chronological structure, the volume enables readers to easily gain a foundational understanding of an important aspect of world history.

To this end, we leverage a panel dataset from the Swiss wheat varieties trial network (N = 1,859) and high-quality weather data. We use a fixed effects estimation framework to estimate precipitation effects and simulate economic losses. We find that precipitation close to harvest significantly increases the risk of a downgrading due to low baking quality. Moreover, downgrading events cause large revenue reductions of up to 1,445 Swiss francs per hectare. This adds new economic insights, highlights the role of weather-dependent crop quality, and provides a basis to improve risk management.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Sorghum’s ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions has placed it in the forefront of discussions regarding potential adaptation paths under climate change. While sorghum may indeed be a good candidate to substitute for other major row crops as warming materializes in areas where it has not traditionally been grown, an equally important consideration is whether its production can be sustained in the warmer areas where it has traditionally been grown. Our findings suggest limited potential for climate change adaption using currently available cultivars but do not preclude the overall role of genetic innovation and enhanced decision making in adapting to climate change. Successful adaptation could perhaps best be facilitated by expanding the scope of genetic stock within sorghum breeding programs.
          , 
            Historical adaptation of sorghum production to arid and semiarid conditions has provided promise regarding its sustained productivity under future warming scenarios. Using Kansas field-trial sorghum data collected from 1985 to 2014 and spanning 408 hybrid cultivars, we show that sorghum productivity under increasing warming scenarios breaks down. Through extensive regression modeling, we identify a temperature threshold of 33 °C, beyond which yields start to decline. We show that this decline is robust across both field-trial and on-farm data. Moderate and higher warming scenarios of 2 °C and 4 °C resulted in roughly 17\% and 44\% yield reductions, respectively. The average reduction across warming scenarios from 1 to 5 °C is 10\% per degree Celsius. Breeding efforts over the last few decades have developed high-yielding cultivars with considerable variability in heat resilience, but even the most tolerant cultivars did not offer much resilience to warming temperatures. This outcome points to two concerns regarding adaption to global warming, the first being that adaptation will not be as simple as producers’ switching among currently available cultivars and the second being that there is currently narrow genetic diversity for heat resilience in US breeding programs. Using observed flowering dates and disaggregating heat-stress impacts, both pre- and postflowering stages were identified to be equally important for overall yields. These findings suggest the adaptation potential for sorghum under climate change would be greatly facilitated by introducing wider genetic diversity for heat resilience into ongoing breeding programs, and that there should be additional efforts to improve resilience during the preflowering phase.},

	abstract = {The so-called global change refers to changes on a planetary scale. The term encompasses various issues like resource use, energy development, population growth, land use and land cover, carbon and nitrogen cycle, pollution and health, and climate change. The paper deals with challenges for dairy cattle production systems in Europe arising from climate change as one part of global changes. Global warming is increasing, and therefore ecosystems, plant and animal biodiversity, and food security and safety are at risk. It is already accepted knowledge that the direct and indirect effects of global warming in combination with an increasing frequency of weather extremes are a serious issue for livestock production, even in moderate climate zones like Central Europe. The potential and already-measurable effects of climate change (including increase in temperature, frequency of hot days and heat waves), in particular the challenges on grassland production, fodder quality, nutrition in general, cow welfare, health as well as performance of dairy production, will be reviewed. Indirect and direct effects on animals are correlated with their performance. There are clear indications that with selection for high-yielding animals the sensitivity to climate changes increases. Cumulative effects (e.g. higher temperature plus increased pathogen and their vectors loads) do strengthen these impacts. To cope with the consequences several possible adaptation and mitigation strategies must be established on different levels. This includes changes in the production systems (e.g. management, barn, feeding), breeding strategies and health management.},

Dairy cattle have become more heat sensitive due to selective breeding for higher production and increased feedlot operations. The harmful effects of heat stress cause hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and other physiological changes in dairy cows. Environmental heat stress causes a decrease in feed intake, leading to a decrease in milk production in dairy cows. The main method to check for reductions in milk production in dairy cows during the summer is an accurate evaluation of heat stress and effective mitigation strategies. Three primary management strategies have been proposed to reduce heat stress and stabilize dairy cattle performance in increasingly hot and humid climates. Short-term management options include physical alteration of the environment and nutritional management, while long-term management strategy includes discovering heat-tolerant genetic traits and genomic selection for heat tolerance. This review looks at how heat stress has affected the dairy industry’s sustainability and elaborates on genomic selection for thermotolerance in dairy cattle as sustainable breeding practices to increase dairy cows’ ability to withstand high temperatures.},

These studies were conducted in 46 countries, and encompassed both research and non-research herds as well as simulation models. The Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) was the most common indicator of heat stress, although a range of atmospheric, physiological, and descriptive indicators were used. Three-quarters of these studies examined at least one heat stress mitigation strategy, such as genetic manipulations, mechanical interventions, and diet manipulation.Approximately 97\% of studies evaluated the impact of heat stress on milk yield, and 10\% of studies examined at least one economic parameter. Research gaps exist in the analysis of economic parameters related to heat stress in dairy cattle. Given the urgent and increasing nature of climate challenges, additional economic analyses of the effects of heat stress in dairy cattle are needed to inform production and animal health decisions in a rapidly changing environment.},

A 10-year dataset (2009–2018), containing 202,776 test-day records from 23,296 Brown Swiss cows, was used. The dataset was merged both with the daily maximum temperature–humidity index (THI) recorded by weather stations and with the daily maximum THI threshold for each trait in Italian Brown Swiss cows. The study considered 4 different HWs according to their length: 2, 3, 4, and 5 consecutive days before the test-day over the weighted THI threshold. Milk production traits were determined as the difference in losses compared to those after only 1 day before the test-day over the weighted maximum THI. All traits showed to be affected by HWs. Particularly, protein percentage losses increased from −0.047\% to −0.070\% after 2 consecutive days over the daily THI threshold, reaching −0.10\% to −0.14\% after 5 days (p {\textless} 0.01), showing a worsening trend with the increasing length of HWs. First parity cows showed to be more sensitive to HWs than other parity classes, recording greater losses after shorter HWs, compared to multiparous cows, for protein yield and, consequently, for cheese production at 24 h. This suggests a less efﬁcient metabolic response to heat stress and exposure time in primiparous, compared to multiparous cows, probably due to their incomplete growth process that overlaps milk production, making it more difﬁcult for them to dissipate heat. Although actions to mitigate heat stress are always needed in livestock, this study points out that often time exposure to warm periods worsens milk production traits in Brown Swiss cows.},

The cows selected for the study were in the middle phase of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd lactation and were characterized by similar daily milk production. Additionally, the animals were kept in the same conditions and fed with the same feeds throughout the season. The analysis covered two 30-day periods – “cold” (April), in which no days with THI {\textgreater}70 were noted, and “hot” (July), in which THI was above 70 for 90\% of the days (74.4 on average). The average daily drop in milk production noted in the hot period was 1.25 kg/cow for multiparous cows and 2.78 kg/cow for primiparous cows. The average daily financial loss resulting from a drop in milk production was €0.55/day/cow in primiparous and €0.46/day/cow in multiparous animals. The calculated daily loss in the profit on production of 1 kg of milk was €0.27/day/kg for primiparous and €0.24/day/kg for multiparous animals. Based on test results, economic losses were simulated depending on the daily milk yield and the size of the primary cattle herd. For the multiparous cows, the estimated losses ranged from €6.07/day (farm sizes 25 cows and average daily milk yield 25 kg) to nearly €219/day (900 cows/ 25 kg). In larger facilities (900 cows) with an average daily milk yield of 55 kg, the daily loss will be about €481. The obtained results confirmed the assumptions made that with a change in microclimate conditions in the barn, a decrease in the daily production and changes in the milk chemical composition were noted, and the economic efficiency of the studied activity decreased.},

The database comprises a wide range of policy types (including regulations and payment schemes) and goals (such as biodiversity conservation, safer pesticide use and reducing nutrient pollution). We illustrate the application of the database by exploring the association between economic development and agri-environmental policies and between the soil-related, agri-environmental policies of countries and their border discontinuities in cropland erosion. A strong, positive link between economic development and implemented agri-environmental policies is revealed, and it is found that 43\% of all global border discontinuities in soil erosion between countries can be explained by differences in their policies.},

We assemble a unique global dataset that combines household-level socioeconomic information with a multi-scalar climatic drought index. Our study conﬁrms the signiﬁcant, yet context-dependent, role of livestock portfolios as a buffering mechanism against the effects of drought on household income and consumption. The effect is driven by the speciﬁc type of animal species, length of the shock, and socioeconomic features. These ﬁndings could assist the design of livestockoriented policy interventions. The novel contributions of this study include the ﬁrst cross-country analysis of the buffering effect of livestock against drought; use of the standardized precipitation-evapotran spiration index as a multi-scalar drought indicator -; and a uniquely extensive dataset allowing for the analysis of interactions.},

	abstract = {Supporting dairy farmers in becoming resilient towards extreme weather requires a broad understanding of the experiences and perceived risks associated with these events from those who undergo them. We used a mixed methods approach to explore national trends of biological consequences on dairy cow udder health and fertility, combined with in-depth farmer conversations around extreme weather events, focusing on heat. The aim is to provide a comprehensive picture of how dairy farmer perceptions, priorities and decision-making are related to the season and extreme weather to identify preventive pathways that can reduce biological costs of heat stress on Swedish dairy cattle during summer. Data collected monthly at cow and farm level between 2016–2019 as part of the Swedish milk and disease recording system confirm seasonal trends and show increased somatic cell counts (SCC) and negatively impacted fertility during summers. In addition, transcriptions of 18 interviews with dairy farmers across the country and seasonal variations of SCC and fertility were thematically analysed. The results suggest that farmers have a broad definition of extreme weather and are aware of the negative impacts. Yet handling of extreme weather events can mainly be classified as reactive. Nevertheless, there are long-term effects on the farm economy, health and herd dynamics. Swedish dairy farmers are currently showing resilience, albeit a fragile one. The capability to ensure sufficient feed production in extreme weather is critical for farm selfperceived resilience. However, acknowledging the long-term biological costs related to fertility, currently not perceived by farmers, has the potential to support proactive planning and improve farm resilience and profitability.},

Using farm and animal-level data from 1435 dairy farms throughout Sweden for 4 years (from 2016 to 2019), we find that a 7-day average of daily maximum temperatures above {\textasciitilde} 20 ºC is associated with sharp declines in milk production. We then estimate the farm-level loss in contribution margin for a typical Swedish dairy farm for the year 2018, which consisted of long-lasting heatwaves and extended summer temperatures. We also estimate that, on average, there are no differences in the impact of heatwaves on milk losses for different dairy breeds but that there exists a trade-off between genetic milk production potential and heat tolerance of a dairy cow. The magnitude of this productivity-tolerance trade-off may differ across breeds, suggesting that the high-production potential animals of certain breeds may be less sensitive to heat stress. These findings have important implications in terms of adapting to heat stress, investing in mitigation measures, and development of future breeds that can ameliorate the current trade-off between production capacity of a cow and its heat tolerance.},

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and speciﬁc climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70\% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Korea, located in East Asia in the northern hemisphere, is experiencing severe climate changes. Specifically, the heat stress caused by global warming is negatively affecting the dairy sector, including milk production and reproductive performance, as the major dairy cattle Holstein-Friesian is particularly susceptible to heat stress. Here, we collected artificial insemination and pregnancy data of the Holstein and the Jersey cows from a dairy farm from 2014 to 2021 and analyzed the association between the conception rate and the temperature-humidity index, calculated using the data from the closest official weather station. As the temperature-humidity index threshold increased, the conception rate gradually decreased. However, this decrease was steeper in the Holstein breed than in the Jersey one at a temperature-humidity index threshold of 75. To evaluate the effects of heat stress on the oocyte quality, we examined the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of Holstein (n = 158, obtained from six animals) and Jersey oocytes (n = 123, obtained from six animals), obtained by ovum pick-up. There were no differences in the nuclear maturation between the different conditions (heat stress: 40.5℃, non- heat stress: 37.5℃) or breeds, although the Holstein oocytes seemed to have a lower metaphase II development (p = 0.0521) after in vitro maturation under heat stress conditions. However, we found that the Holstein metaphase II oocytes exposed to heat stress presented more reactive oxygen species and a peripheral distribution of the mitochondria, compared to those of the Jersey cattle. Here, we show that weather information from local meteorological stations can be used to calculate the temperature-humidity index threshold at which heat stress influences the conception rate, and that the Jersey cows are more tolerant to heat stress in terms of their conception rate at a temperature-humidity index over 75. The lower fertility of the Holstein cows is likely attributed to impaired cytoplasmic maturation induced by heat stress. Thus, the Jersey cows can be a good breed for the sustainability of dairy farms for addressing climate changes in South Korea, as they are more resistant to hyperthermia.},

	abstract = {Heat stress is an important problem for dairy industry in many parts of the world owing to its adverse effects on productivity and profitability. Heat stress in dairy cattle is caused by an increase in core body temperature, which affects the fat production in the mammary gland. It reduces milk yield, dry matter intake, and alters the milk composition, such as fat, protein, lactose, and solids-not-fats percentages among others. Understanding the biological mechanisms of climatic adaptation, identifying and exploring signatures of selection, genomic diversity and identification of candidate genes for heat tolerance within indicine and taurine dairy breeds is an important progression toward breeding better dairy cattle adapted to changing climatic conditions of the tropics. Identifying breeds that are heat tolerant and their use in genetic improvement programs is crucial for improving dairy cattle productivity and profitability in the tropics. Genetic improvement for heat tolerance requires availability of genetic parameters, but these genetic parameters are currently missing in many tropical countries. In this article, we reviewed the HS effects on dairy cattle with regard to (1) physiological parameters; (2) milk yield and composition traits; and (3) milk and blood metabolites for dairy cattle reared in tropical countries. In addition, mitigation strategies such as physical modification of environment, nutritional, and genetic development of heat tolerant dairy cattle to prevent the adverse effects of HS on dairy cattle are discussed. In tropical climates, a more and cost-effective strategy to overcome HS effects is to genetically select more adaptable and heat tolerant breeds, use of crossbred animals for milk production, i.e., crosses between indicine breeds such as Gir, white fulani, N’Dama, Sahiwal or Boran to taurine breeds such as Holstein-Friesian, Jersey or Brown Swiss. The results of this review will contribute to policy formulations with regard to strategies for mitigating the effects of HS on dairy cattle in tropical countries.},

            Dairy products are a key source of valuable proteins and fats for many millions of people worldwide. Dairy cattle are highly susceptible to heat-stress induced decline in milk production, and as the frequency and duration of heat-stress events increases, the long term security of nutrition from dairy products is threatened. Identification of dairy cattle more tolerant of heat stress conditions would be an important progression towards breeding better adapted dairy herds to future climates. Breeding for heat tolerance could be accelerated with genomic selection, using genome wide DNA markers that predict tolerance to heat stress. Here we demonstrate the value of genomic predictions for heat tolerance in cohorts of Holstein cows predicted to be heat tolerant and heat susceptible using controlled-climate chambers simulating a moderate heatwave event. Not only was the heat challenge stimulated decline in milk production less in cows genomically predicted to be heat-tolerant, physiological indicators such as rectal and intra-vaginal temperatures had reduced increases over the 4 day heat challenge. This demonstrates that genomic selection for heat tolerance in dairy cattle is a step towards securing a valuable source of nutrition and improving animal welfare facing a future with predicted increases in heat stress events.},

Three different production systems were defined: A production system characterized by intensive crop production (=indoor housing), a pasture based production system, and a maritime region. Heat stress was assessed by two temperature-humidity indices (THI) modelled as random regression coefficients in an analysis of variance: One (THIBo) was defined as an average of hourly THI, calculated from hourly recorded temperatures and humidities, the other (THIRa) was based on daily maximal temperature and daily minimal humidity. In all production systems, THIBo=60 and THIRa=70 were identified as general thresholds denoting a substantial decline in test-day milk yield. For daily fat and protein percentage, no universally valid thresholds were identified. In contrast for SCS, especially in the maritime region, heat stress as well as cold stress thresholds were found. Regression analysis was used to study the change in test day milk yield in response to THI of those THI ranges with an obvious decline in milk yield. Regression coefficients were −0.08 kg/THIBo and −0.16 kg/THIRa for the crop production system, −0.17 kg/THIBo and −0.23 kg/THIRa for the pasture based system, and −0.26 kg/THIBo and −0.47kg/THIRa for the maritime region. Based on statistical information criteria, identified thresholds for THIBo should be given preference over THIRa when applying genetic studies on heat stress in German Holstein cows.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a problem that causes many environmental issues that impact the productivity of livestock species. One of the major issues associated with climate change is an increase of the frequency of hot days and heat waves, which increases the risk of heat stress for livestock species. Dairy cattle have been identified as being susceptible to heat stress due to their high metabolic heat load. Studies have shown heat stress impacts several biological processes that can result in large economic consequences. When heat stress occurs, dairy cattle employ several physiological and cellular mechanisms in order to dissipate heat and protect cells from damage. These mechanisms require an increase and diversion in energy toward protection and away from other biological processes. Therefore, in turn heat stress in dairy cattle can lead numerous issues including reductions in milk production and reproduction as well as increased risk for disease and mortality. This indicates a need to select dairy cattle that would be thermotolerant. Various selection strategies to confer thermotolerance have been discussed in the literature, including selecting for reduced milk production, crossbreeding with thermotolerant breeds, selecting based on physiological traits and most recently selecting for enhanced immune response. This review discusses the various issues associated with heat stress in dairy cattle and the pros and cons to the various selection strategies that have been proposed to select for thermotolerance in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Heat can cause substantial yield losses in crop production and climate change is increasing the risk of this kind of damage. Weather index insurance can help to reduce the financial losses resulting from heat exposure. This paper introduces crop-specific payout functions based on restricted cubic splines in heat index insurance. The use of restricted cubic splines is a cutting-edge method to reflect empirically estimated temperature effects on crop yields and to estimate temperature-related yield losses. The integration of these temperature effects in payout functions facilitates insurance design and allows hourly temperatures to be used as the underlying index. An empirical analysis is used to assess heat stress effects for a panel of East German winter wheat and winter rapeseed producers, to calibrate insurance contracts accordingly and simulate the resulting risk reducing ca­ pacities. We find that the insurance scheme introduced here leads to statistically and economically significant out-of-sample risk reducing capacities for farmers, i.e. risk premiums are reduced by up to approximately 20\% at the median, in comparison to the uninsured status and at the actuarially fair premium. Moreover, we highlight that policy-makers can support the cost-efficient provision of market-based weather index insurance by fostering data collection and data provision.},

Previous studies suggest that heat exerts considerable negative effects on milk production and its composition, especially during summer months. We investigate the production and fat composition of milk from individual dairy cows and develop a modelling framework that investigates the effect of temperature by extending a traditional lactation curve model onto a more flexible statistical modelling framework, a generalised additive model (GAM). The GAM simultaneously copes with multiple different conditions (temperature, parity, days of lactation, etc.), and, importantly, their non-linear relationships. Our analysis of retrospective data suggests that individual cows respond differently to heat; cows producing relatively high quantities of milk tend to be particularly sensitive to heat. Our model also suggests that most dairy cows studied fall into three distinct cases that underpin the variation of the milk fat ratio by different mechanisms.},

Insurance solutions can compensate for the resulting financial losses and thereby serves as important risk manage­ ment tool. While insurance providers in Europe have recently largely expanded the number and scope of offered weather insurance solutions, this remained undocumented in scientific literature. We here provide a structured assessment of agricultural insurance products that are on the market to cover weather risks in crop and horticulture production in dynamic European insurance markets, focusing on Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. We systematically collect information on supplied insurance products (N = 107) and find large diversity in market concentrations, offered products, insured weather risks, and political market interventions. We find that for most economically relevant weather risks (especially for hail), insurance solutions are available to farmers, but we identify certain insurance protection gaps (e.g., flood in Ger­ many). Additionally, drought and heat risks seem underrepresented in current insurance prod­ ucts, especially given their economic relevance. Indemnity insurance (where payouts are based on assessed losses) is offered most frequently, but weather index insurance (where payouts depend on the realization of an index, such as cumulative precipitation) is also increasingly available in Europe. Most of current weather index insurance solutions have a unique design, indicating a preference to stand out from the competition, and we observe little knowledge spillovers between markets. There are different levels of political market intervention and in particular a trend to introduce premium subsidies and towards a convergence of premium subsidy levels between markets. We highlight the need to align any political market intervention to other policy goals and to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. Finally, we underline the important role of research in improving current insurance systems.},

A gridded dataset of expected future climate change signals for seasonal averages of daily mean temperature and precipitation in Switzerland is presented. The basic scenarios are taken from the CH2011 initiative. In CH2011, a Bayesian framework was applied to obtain probabilistic scenarios for three regions within Switzerland. Here, the results for two additional Alpine sub-regions are presented. The regional estimates have then been downscaled onto a regular latitudelongitude grid with a resolution of 0.02° or roughly 2 km. The downscaling procedure is based on the spatial structure of the climate change signals as simulated by the underlying regional climate models and relies on a Kriging with external drift using height as auxiliary predictor. The considered emission scenarios are A1B, A2 and the mitigation scenario RCP3PD. The new dataset shows an expected warming of about 1 to 6 °C until the end of the 21st century, strongly depending on the scenario and the lead time. Owing to a large vertical gradient, the warming is about 1 °C stronger in the Alps than in the Swiss lowlands. In case of precipitation, the projection uncertainty is large and in most seasons precipitation can increase or decrease. In summer a distinct decrease of precipitation can be found, again strongly depending on the emission scenario.},

	abstract = {Grassland based farming systems are exposed to extreme weather events causing volatile farm incomes. Grazing and lacking yield measurements make it largely impossible to insure grassland production with traditional insurance products. In contrast, index insurance products have the potential to insure grasslands, as their payoff relies on an endogenous index that is highly correlated to, but independent of, the actual grass yield. To support future development of these products, we provide the first systematic overview of 12 index insurances put into practise for grasslands in Europe and North America. Additionally, based on this overview, we present prevailing findings that are important for further research and insurance practitioners. We find that a large diversity of index insurance types is applied in practise, including insurance solutions based on regional yield levels, weather variables or satellite imagery. We reveal separated insurance markets (i.e. country-specific products), which prevent knowledge spillovers and lead to largely isolated product developments. Thus, grassland insurance schemes can be improved by knowledge exchange and combining methods that are applied elsewhere. More specifically, insurances tailored to single farm's risk exposure, the combination of satellite with other geodata (e.g. land use information) or adapting legal specifications that disadvantage some types of insurances can improve an insurance's risk reducing capacity and make grassland based farming systems more resilient to weather extremes. This paper provides an entry point for such process, ensuring the development of efficient measures for farmers to cope with climatic risks.},

            This study provides insights for wheat breeding efforts, public policy, and agricultural decision making related to climate change. Our findings provide opportunities for the international wheat breeding community to intensify research efforts to increase resistance to heat stress during focused developmental stages. These efforts could result in net positive warming effects since reduced exposure to freeze was found to be a yield-enhancing benefit of warming. Our results indicate that advancements in heat resistance could come at the expense of higher average yields, and that there is currently limited scope for producer adaptation through alternative variety selection. Our results also suggest that irrigation could help mitigate the effects of warming, which has implications for policies focused on the conservation of increasingly scarce water resources.
          , 
            Climate change is expected to increase future temperatures, potentially resulting in reduced crop production in many key production regions. Research quantifying the complex relationship between weather variables and wheat yields is rapidly growing, and recent advances have used a variety of model specifications that differ in how temperature data are included in the statistical yield equation. A unique data set that combines Kansas wheat variety field trial outcomes for 1985–2013 with location-specific weather data is used to analyze the effect of weather on wheat yield using regression analysis. Our results indicate that the effect of temperature exposure varies across the September−May growing season. The largest drivers of yield loss are freezing temperatures in the Fall and extreme heat events in the Spring. We also find that the overall effect of warming on yields is negative, even after accounting for the benefits of reduced exposure to freezing temperatures. Our analysis indicates that there exists a tradeoff between average (mean) yield and ability to resist extreme heat across varieties. More-recently released varieties are less able to resist heat than older lines. Our results also indicate that warming effects would be partially offset by increased rainfall in the Spring. Finally, we find that the method used to construct measures of temperature exposure matters for both the predictive performance of the regression model and the forecasted warming impacts on yields.},

The simulated pattern of regional changes in dairy output is not a simple function of the changes in dairy productivity. Our results show that the relative size of productivity changes across regions aﬀects the relative competitive advantage of dairy-producing regions. Several factors aﬀect the regional distribution of simulated dairy-output changes, including substitution among sources of dairy output and competition for inputs like supplementary feed. An increased output in regions with moderate reductions in dairy productivity may occur because the severely climate-aﬀected regions absorb the greatest loss in output.},

Also, to outline how milk production losses and consequent costs from this can be estimated and minimised. Procedures Long-term meteorological data for Australia were analysed to determine the distribution of hot conditions over space and time. Fifteen dairy production regions were identified for higher-resolution data analysis. Both the raw meteorological data and their integration into a temperaturehumidity thermal index were compiled onto a computer program. This mapping software displays the distribution of climatic patterns, both Australia-wide and within the selected dairying regions. Graphical displays of the variation in historical records for 200 locations in the 15 dairying regions are also available. As a separate study, production data from research stations, on-farm trials and milk factory records were statistically analysed and correlated with the climatic indices, to estimate production losses due to hot conditions.
Results Both milk yields and milk constituents declined with increases in the temperature-humidity index. The onset and rate of this decline are dependent on a number of factors, including location, level of production, adaptation, and management regime. These results have been integrated into a farm-level economic analysis for managers of dairy properties.
Conclusion By considering the historical patterns of hot conditions over time and space, along with expected production losses, managers of dairy farms can now conduct an economic evaluation of investment strategies to alleviate heat loads. These strategies include the provision of sprinklers, shade structures, or combinations of these.},

While many studies on Climate Change Impact Assessment (CCIA) deal with crop farming, little has been done with regard to livestock farming. This paper aims to shed light on the present state of research in the field of dairy farming, one of the major sectors in agriculture, in a three-fold manner. First, potential climate change impacts in dairy farming are discussed qualitatively. Second, challenges and methodological approaches in economic CCIA are presented, with a closer look at the issue of climate data and farm-level adaptation. Third, an overview and assessment of available studies on economic CCIA in dairy farming along a set of evaluation criteria is provided. The paper concludes with further research opportunities in this field.},

Herein, we review the effects of high temperature and humidity on body temperature, feed intake, milk production, follicle development, estrous behavior, and pregnancy in dairy cows. Analyses of the effects of THI on dairy production have shown that body temperature is an important physiological parameter in the evaluation of the health state of dairy cows. Although THI is an important environmental index and can help to infer the degree of heat stress, it does not reflect the physiological changes experienced by dairy cows undergoing heat stress. How­ever, the simultaneous measurement of THI and physiological indexes (e.g., body temperature) would be very useful for improving dairy production. The successful development of automatic detection techniques makes it possible to combine THI with other physiological indexes (i.e., body temperature and activity), which could help us to comprehensively evaluate heat stress in dairy cows and provide important technical support to effectively prevent heat stress.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that global warming is unequivocal. Dairy production systems are considered as important sources of greenhouse gas emissions; however, little is known about the sensitivity and vulnerability of these production systems themselves to climate warming. This review brings different aspects of dairy cow production in Central Europe into focus, with a holistic approach to emphasize potential future consequences and challenges arising from climate change. With the current understanding of the effects of climate change, it is expected that yield of forage per hectare will be inﬂuenced positively, whereas quality will mainly depend on water availability and soil characteristics. Thus, the botanical composition of future grassland should include species that are able to withstand the changing conditions (e.g. lucerne and bird’s foot trefoil). Changes in nutrient concentration of forage plants, elevated heat loads and altered feeding patterns of animals may inﬂuence rumen physiology. Several promising nutritional strategies are available to lower potential negative impacts of climate change on dairy cow nutrition and performance. Adjustment of feeding and drinking regimes, diet composition and additive supplementation can contribute to the maintenance of adequate dairy cow nutrition and performance. Provision of adequate shade and cooling will reduce the direct effects of heat stress. As estimated genetic parameters are promising, heat stress tolerance as a functional trait may be included into breeding programmes. Indirect effects of global warming on the health and welfare of animals seem to be more complicated and thus are less predictable. As the epidemiology of certain gastrointestinal nematodes and liver ﬂuke is favourably inﬂuenced by increased temperature and humidity, relations between climate change and disease dynamics should be followed closely. Under current conditions, climate change associated economic impacts are estimated to be neutral if some form of adaptation is integrated. Therefore, it is essential to establish and adopt mitigation strategies covering available tools from management, nutrition, health and plant and animal breeding to cope with the future consequences of climate change on dairy farming.},

Although global warming is expected to increase both the frequency and severity of heat stress on dairy cattle, there are very few economic studies focusing on this issue. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating the frontier methodology, commonly used in applied production economics, with heat stress indexes used by animal scientists but largely ignored by economists. Our econometric models are useful to quantify gross beneﬁts expected from adaptation to climatic conditions represented by the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and alternatively by the Equivalent Temperature Index (ETI). Stochastic production frontier analysis is used to measure technical eﬃciency for an unbalanced panel of 103 dairy farms located in Florida and Georgia. Five alternative model speciﬁcations are evaluated. The results reveal that both THI and ETI have a signiﬁcant nonlinear negative eﬀect on milk production. The climatic indexes when incorporated in the frontier speciﬁcation absorb some of the output shortfall that otherwise would be attributable to ineﬃciency. The results indicate that using fans combined with sprinklers is an eﬀective adaptation to oﬀset output losses stemming from heat stress conditions.},

	abstract = {The current changing climate trend poses a threat to the productive efficacy and welfare of livestock across the globe. This review is an attempt to synthesize information pertaining to the applications of various genomic tools and statistical models that are available to identify climate-resilient dairy cows. The different functional and economical traits which govern milk production play a significant role in determining the cost of milk production. Thus, identification of these traits may revolutionize the breeding programs to develop climate-resilient dairy cattle. Moreover, the genotype–environment interaction also influences the performance of dairy cattle especially during a challenging situation. The recent advancement in molecular biology has led to the development of a few biotechnological tools and statistical models like next-generation sequencing (NGS), microarray technology, whole transcriptome analysis, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which can be used to quantify the molecular mechanisms which govern the climate resilience capacity of dairy cows. Among these, the most preferred option for researchers around the globe was GWAS as this approach jointly takes into account all the genotype, phenotype, and pedigree information of farm animals. Furthermore, selection signatures can also help to demarcate functionally important regions in the genome which can be used to detect potential loci and candidate genes that have undergone positive selection in complex milk production traits of dairy cattle. These identified biomarkers can be incorporated in the existing breeding policies using genomic selection to develop climate-resilient dairy cattle.},

The semi-arid regions of the Free State –Bloemfontein, Bothaville, and Bethlehem were selected for the study. To estimate the impact of heat stress on milk production, baseline (1950–1999) and mid-century (2040–2070) climate data and Temperature Humidity Index thresholds (THIthershold) of 70 and 65 were used. Mid-century data with no adaptation strategy resulted in a doubled loss, while moderate heat-mitigation strategies (wetting and forced ventilation) resulted in positive improvements in milk production and income of farmers. Results show strong polynomial correlations (R2 of 0.73–0.79) between the Tmax and milk-production losses where above Tmax of 25 C, milk-production loss increased sharply. The combined average loss of milk production during the hot summer was estimated at 0.35 liters per cow in a day, which is equivalent to ZAR1.27 per cow per day. With changing climate, the highest revenue loss was recorded in the MPI\_ESM\_MR future climate scenario. Moreover, results from the questionnaires show that heat stress reduces farmers’ milk production signiﬁcantly in the summertime, and for most of the respondents, measures that should be taken are too costly to apply. Exhaustive analysis of the economic impacts of heat stress on milk production is recommended for future studies, as it is an important sector in alleviating household food insecurity in South Africa.},

	abstract = {Heat stress has consequences on both the physiology and reproductive performance of cows, but the most dramatic effect for dairy producers is the decrease produced in fertility. The effects of heat stress on fertility include an increased number of days open, reduced conception rate, and larger number of cows suffering different types of anestrus. Once becomes pregnant, heat stress affects also the reproductive success of the cow through its direct effects on the ovary, uterus, gametes, embryo, and early fetus. This article reviews current knowledge of the effects of heat stress on fertility in dairy cows and the hormonal strategies used to mitigate these effects at the farm level. Administration of GnRH at the moment of artiﬁcial insemination can improve the conception rate. Breeding synchronization protocols for ﬁxed-time insemination may reduce the calving conception interval and the number of services per conception. Progesterone-based protocols seem resolve better the reproductive disorders related to a hot environment (anestrus) than GnRHbased protocols. The use of combinations of GnRH, eCG, and hCG in progesterone-based protocols can improve results. Progesterone supplementation during the late embryonic and/or early fetal period would be useful in curtailing pregnancy losses, mainly in single pregnancies, whereas a more positive effect of treatment with GnRH than progesterone has been found in twin pregnancies. Melatonin therapy is emerging as a promising strategy to improve the natural reproductive performance of cows suffering conditions of heat stress.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to provide a review of factors inﬂuencing heat stress in lactating dairy cows and how it affects milk production. In warmer parts of the world, during summer months in the United States, and in other temperate regions, reduced milk production resulting from heat stress counteracts tremendous genetic progress achieved in increasing milk production. Genetic progress in milk production is closely related to increased feed intake. High feed intake results in raised metabolic heat increment. High metabolic heat increment requires effective thermoregulatory mechanisms to maintain body temperature in a thermoneutral zone and in physiological homeostasis. Cows can succumb to hyperthermia if they fail to maintain thermoneutrality. Accurate measurement of when cows enter heat stress is complicated because the responses to heat stress affect not only the energy balance, but also water, sodium, potassium and chlorine metabolism. Water, sodium, potassium and chlorine are important constituents of sweat, and sweating is a major, if not the most important, thermoregulatory mechanism used to dissipate excess body heat. Due to high metabolic heat increment, and especially in the warmer months, high-producing dairy cows may enter heat stress much earlier than their lower-producing counterparts and than currently thought, or extra heat has been accommodated by physiological adaptations. Should this be the case, then strategies to reduce heat stress must be developed to enable cows to express their full genetic potential. The thermoneutral zone, heat production and heat gain, heat dissipation mechanisms, and how the lactating cow responds to heat stress are discussed.},

            A pressing question for climate change adaptation is whether ongoing transformations of the agricultural sector affect its ability to cope with climatic variations. We examine this question in the United States, where major increases in productivity have fueled most of agricultural production growth over the past half-century. To quantify the evolving climate sensitivity of the sector and identify its sources, we combine state-level measures of agricultural productivity with detailed climate data for 1960–2004. We find that agriculture is growing more sensitive to climate in Midwestern states for two distinct but compounding reasons: a rising climatic sensitivity of nonirrigated cereal and oilseed crops and a growing specialization in crop production. In contrast, other regions specialize in less climate-sensitive production such as irrigated specialty crops or livestock. Results suggest that reducing vulnerability to climate change should consider the role of policies in inducing regional specialization.},

	abstract = {Extreme temperatures are associated with increased mortality among humans. Because similar epidemiologic studies in animals may add to the existing evidence, we investigated the association between ambient temperature and the risk of mortality among dairy cattle. We used data on 87,108 dairy cow deaths in Belgium from 2006 to 2009, and we combined a case-crossover design with distributed lag non-linear models. Province-speciﬁc results were combined in a multivariate meta-analysis. Relative to the estimated minimum mortality temperature of 15.4 °C (75th percentile), the pooled cumulative relative risks over lag 0–25 days were 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.11, 1.42) for extreme cold (1st percentile, À 3.5 °C), 1.35 (95\% CI: 1.19, 1.54) for moderate cold (5th percentile, À 0.3 °C), 1.09 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.17) for moderate heat (95th percentile, 19.7 °C), and 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.08; 1.48) for extreme heat (99th percentile, 22.6 °C). The temporal pattern of the temperature-mortality association was similar to that observed in humans, i.e. acute effects of heat and delayed and prolonged effects of cold. Seasonal analyses suggested that most of the temperature-related mortality, including cold effects, occurred in the warm season. Our study reinforces the evidence on the plausibility of causal effects in humans.},

Reduced productive output during heat stress was traditionally thought to result from decreased nutrient intake. Our observations challenge this dogma and indicate that heat-stressed animals employ novel homeorhetic strategies to direct metabolic and fuel selection priorities independent of nutrient intake or energy balance. Alterations in systemic physiology support a shift in carbohydrate metabolism, evident through changes such as basal and stimulated circulating insulin levels. Hepatocyte and myocyte metabolism also show clear differences in glucose production and use during heat stress. Perhaps most intriguing, given the energetic shortfall of the heat-stressed animal, is the apparent lack of fat mobilization from adipose tissue coupled with a reduced responsiveness to lipolytic stimuli. Thus, the heat stress response markedly alters postabsorptive carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism independently of reduced feed intake through coordinated changes in fuel supply and utilization by multiple tissues.},

	abstract = {Background:  The impacts of climate change on crop and livestock sectors are well-documented. Climate change and its related events (e.g., high temperatures, extreme events, disease outbreaks) affect livestock production in various ways (e.g., nutrition, housing, health, welfare), and tend to compromise the physical productivity and the economic performances. Understanding animal responses to climate change may help planning strategies to cope with the adverse climatic conditions and also to reduce polluting emissions. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we develop a conceptual framework to assess and develop new organisational models for Mediterranean small-scale farming systems so as to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to improve farm management and farming tech‑nologies, and to achieve an effective adaptation to the climate changes. The conceptual framework consists of four phases: (i) community engagement, (ii) strategies development, (iii) data collection and analysis, (iv) business model generation and sustainability assessment. We assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the ecosolutions by mean of a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis technique.
Results:  The proposed eco-solutions are expected to increase the sustainability of agriculture and food production systems by introducing new and efficient uses of natural resources. The proposed models are expected to have an impact not only on the environment (in terms of mitigation), but also on the economic and social performances, as they are expected to foster the responses of small-scale farms to the increasingly frequent effects of climate change (adaptation solutions). Among the positive impacts, we emphasise the importance of more stable revenues, a tendency that would help farmers to raise their revenues. Last but not least, we found that the proposed models are likely to increase the social resilience of the farming systems to the challenges imposed by the climate change.
Conclusions:  The eco-solutions can support stakeholders involved in Mediterranean small-scale farming systems by suggesting novel land, crop, and livestock management approaches to optimise revenue flows, business models and climate change mitigation strategies thanks to the adoption of a systemic approach, that is not only focused on specific components of the system but instead based on the linkages between environmental, social, and economic aspects.},

Numerous studies have detected significant changes in the observed occurrence of extreme heat events, irrespective of how such events are defined. Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature. We also explore risks associated with compound extreme events and nonlinear impacts associated with extreme heat.},

	abstract = {A better understanding of how livestock respond to weather is essential to enable farming to adapt to a changing climate. Climate change is mainly expected to impact dairy cattle through heat stress and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. We investigated the effects of weather on milk yield and composition (fat and protein content) in an experimental dairy herd in Scotland over 21 years. Holstein Friesian cows were either housed indoors in winter and grazed over the summer or were continuously housed. Milk yield was measured daily, resulting in 762 786 test day records from 1369 individuals, and fat and protein percentage were sampled once a week, giving 89 331 records from 1220 cows/trait. The relative inﬂuence of 11 weather elements, measured from local outdoor weather stations, and two indices of temperature and humidity (THI), indicators of heat stress, were compared using separate maximum likelihood models for each element or index. Models containing a direct measure of temperature (dry bulb, wet bulb, grass or soil temperature) or a THI provided the best ﬁts to milk yield and fat data; wind speed and the number of hours of sunshine were most important in explaining protein content. Weather elements summarised across a week’s timescale from the test day usually explained milk yield and fat content better than shorter-scale (3 day, test day, test day −1) metrics. Then, examining a subset of key weather variables using restricted maximum likelihood, we found that THI, wind speed and the number of hours of sunshine inﬂuenced milk yield and composition. The shape and magnitude of these effects depended on whether animals were inside or outside on the test day. The milk yield of cows outdoors was lower at the extremes of THI than at average values, and the highest yields were obtained when THI, recorded at 0900 h, was 55 units. Cows indoors decreased milk yield as THI increased. Fat content was lower at higher THIs than at intermediate THIs in both environments. Protein content decreased as THI increased in animals kept indoors and outdoors, and the rate of decrease was greater when animals were outside than when they were inside. Moderate wind speeds appeared to alleviate heat stress. These results show that milk yield and composition are impacted at the upper extreme of THI under conditions currently experienced in Scotland, where animals have so far experienced little pressure to adapt to heat stress.},

Data were collected from Dairy Herd Improvement Association records of 142 Jersey and 586 Holstein cows from the Bearden Dairy Research Center at Mississippi State University (Mississippi State). Heat stress climatic conditions were determined using a temperaturehumidity index (THI) to combine dry bulb temperature and relative humidity into one measure. Two analyses were conducted to determine the effects of HS. Heat stress was defined as THI ≥72, and reported as HS+ for the first analysis and HS for the second analysis. The first analysis compared breeds during HS+ and non-heat-stress (HS−) conditions. Holstein milk yield decreased during HS+, whereas Jersey milk yield increased. Milk fat percentage for Holstein and Jersey cows declined during HS+. Holstein fat-corrected milk yield decreased during HS+, whereas Jersey fat-corrected milk yield during HS+ did not differ from that during HS−. During HS+, somatic cell score increased in milk from Holstein and Jersey cows compared with HS−. In the second analysis, HS was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. The corresponding THI values were THI ≥72 but {\textless}79, THI ≥79 but {\textless}90, and THI ≥90. Holstein milk yield declined during moderate and severe HS, whereas Jersey milk yield declined during severe HS. Holstein milk fat percentage was less during moderate and severe HS compared with milk fat percentage during mild HS. Jersey milk fat percentage did not differ with regard to HS category. Jersey cows appeared to be more heat tolerant than Holstein cows; however, Holstein cows still produced larger volumes of milk.},

	abstract = {There are clear signs that milk production growth is leveling off, and recently even declining, in China. Heat stress is one of the main reasons for the recent reduction in milk production. In this study, we computed the change in milk production as a result of heat stress in major milk production areas in China. We constructed a temperature–humidity index (THI) spatial layer to understand the monthly distribution of heat and moisture. We documented specific areas in northern China where cattle were at high risk to heat stress in specific months. THI values exceeded the threshold above which milk production declines during months of June, July, and August. Especially during July, the THI value was higher than the production threshold in recent years (2008 to 2016) and in projected future scenarios (2050 and 2070). THI-based milk yield losses were up from 0.7 to about 4 kg per cow per day in July 2016. These losses are projected to increase from 1.5 to 6.5 kg in 2050 and 2 to 7.2 kg in 2070 (representing production losses between 15 and 50\%). These results suggest that climate change will have significant consequences for the dairy sector in major milk-producing areas in China. Our results are useful in identifying areas susceptible to heat stress where adaptive livestock management practices are needed to prevent significant production decreases.},

The aim of the present study was to determine if a threshold of temperaturehumidity index (THI) exists for multiple milk production traits (milk yield, fat-corrected milk, protein and fat yield and percentage, energy-corrected milk, cheese production, and cheese yield) in Italian Brown Swiss dairy cows from the period 15 d before the day of the Italian Breeders Association test-day sampling. A 10yr data set (2009–2018) containing 202,776 test-day records of 23,296 Brown Swiss cows was matched with the maximum THI. In all parities considered, no THI thresholds were observed for milk yield in Brown Swiss. In contrast, a THI threshold of 75 was identified for fat-corrected milk. No THI threshold was found for fat percentage, but fat yield showed the highest THI thresholds in cows of first and second parity. Protein yield and cheese production were affected by heat stress with average THI threshold of 74. The THI thresholds identified indicate that the Brown Swiss breed has higher thermal tolerance versus literature values reported for Holstein cows. As THI rises, Brown Swiss cows tend to produce the same volume of milk, but with a decreasing quality with regard to components. Further study is necessary to estimate the genetic component of heat tolerance, in Brown Swiss cattle, considering that the correct estimation of THI thresholds represents the first step to identify components that could be included in selection procedures.},

Using a temperature-humidity index (THI), we investigate the effect of past heatwaves in the UK on heat-stress in dairy herds.

However, during the heatwaves of 2003 and 2006, this threshold was exceeded on typically 5 days on average in the Midlands, south and east of England. Most dairy cattle are in the west and north of the country and so did not experience the severest heat. Milk yield data in the south-west of England show that a few herds experienced decreases in yields during 2003 and 2006. We used the 11-member regional climate model ensemble with the A1B scenario from UKCP09 to investigate the possible future change in days exceeding the THI threshold for the onset of mild heat-stress. The number of days where the THI exceeds this threshold could increase to over 20 days yr−1 in southern parts of England by the end of the century.},

	abstract = {Changes in temperature, CO2, and precipitation under the scenarios of climate change for the next 30 yr present a challenge to crop production. This review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. There is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional differences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further complicated. For example, the temperature effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4\% in the South but an increase of 1.7\% in the Midwest. The frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. The increase in CO2 contributes significantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use efficiency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the changing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population.},

	abstract = {Animal’s well-being, growth, and production are modulated by environmental conditions, and managemental practices and can be deleteriously affected by global warming phenomenon. In the recent years, unprecedented climatic fluctuations like sustained higher temperatures and humidity, heat waves, and solar flares have led to economic losses in \$ billions to both milk and meat industry. It is estimated that by 2050, the US dairy industry alone will borne more than \$1.7 billion loss. As human dependency on animal products like milk, meat, and eggs for nutrition is exponentially rising, there is urgency for maximum production. The high yielding animals are already under tremendous metabolic pressure making them more susceptible to adverse climatic conditions. When exposed to heat stress, livestock display a variety of behavioral and physiological acclimatization as essential survival strategies, but at the cost of decreased milk, meat, or egg production. Most of the studies have explored the heat stress in animals and its effect on different milk productions in a specific region or country. A clear understanding of the impact of global warming on dairy enterprise is yet to be comprehended. So this exploratory study will analyze impact of global warming on current milk production trends, economics, and future perspectives.},

	abstract = {Lactating dairy cows exhibit a myriad of responses to heat stress. These responses partially facilitate the thermal balance between heat gain and heat loss, but also account for reduction in productivity. Decreased milk yield is the most recognized impact of heat stress on a dairy cow and results in signiﬁcant economic loss to dairy producers. The reduced milk yield by heat stress is observed when daily average temperature-humidity index exceeds 68, above which the milk yield of a cow is negatively correlated with temperature-humidity index or dry bulb temperature. Milk yield is also positively correlated with body temperature of the cows under evaporative cooling, which reﬂects the positive relationship between metabolic heat production and milk yield. During summer, feed intake is positively correlated with milk yield, and the decreased intake explains at least half of the reduction in milk yield by heat stress. These emphasize the importance of maintaining intake on productivity during summer. Although not entirely clear, mechanisms that mediate the reduced milk yield by heat stress in addition to intake may be multifactorial. These could include but are not limited to altered metabolism, potential activation of immune system and inﬂammation, changes in behavior, and altered mammary gland development and function.},

Methods that livestock producers use to mitigate thermal stress—including modiﬁcations to animal management or housing—tend to increase production costs. We use operation-level economic data coupled with ﬁnely-scaled climate data to estimate how the local thermal environment affects the technical efﬁciency of dairies across the United States. We then use this information to estimate the possible decline in milk production in 2030 resulting from climate change-induced heat stress under the simplifying assumptions that the production technology, location of production, and other factors are held constant. For four climate model scenarios, the results indicate modest heat-stress-related production declines by 2030, with the largest declines occurring in the southern states.},
