Results suggest that even when premiums are at higher than actuarially fair levels and the insurance purchaser is faced with both spatial and temporal basis risks, a temperature–humidity index insurance product would provide risk management benefits to a representative south-central Georgia dairy producer.},

Switzerland provides an interesting case because its policy is exceptionally targeted towards the establishment of sustainable production systems. We describe the history and the current state of Swiss agricultural policy, review evaluations of policy reforms, summarise their impact and outline the lessons learned for policy developments in other countries. We discuss four implications: i) some goals have been met, albeit at a high cost, and so, increasing efficiency of policies is key; ii) there is a need for more coherence and coordination regarding the different policy programmes (i.e. in the sense of a ‘food system policy’); iii) cross-compliance measures (i.e. minimum standards for receiving support) have an important leverage effect; and iv) policy differentiation (e.g. by spatial targeting) and increasing farmers’ discretion over how to achieve goals (e.g. by implementing results-based payments) are key for future policies.},

 abstract = {The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

abstract="The relevance of longevity among the traits in dairy cattle for which genetic improvements are desirable is undisputed as welfare and economic considerations underline this importance. Longevity, again as seen in the context of many relevant traits, is a difficult trait since early selection decisions are desired but the precise longevity of an individual animal can only be derived after its death and thus at a later stage in the trajectory of time. Several approaches for modelling of longevity exist, among them are survival analysis and random regression models that by definition are highly suitable to model effects along the trajectory of time. In a broader sense, the concept of longevity has to be extended to robustness and resilience. This latter term has recently gained in popularity as in general definitions are sought that reflect an individual's ability to cope with stressors, be it individual diseases or relevant effects such as hygiene, heat stress, and energy balance. The genetic ability for a long productive life of an individual in a dairy cattle population is only inadequately described by simple measurements of longevity. In this context, cow training sets with precise recordings of diseases and other relevant effects as well as new biomarkers giving more insight into the physiological status of a cow are needed. In future dairy cattle breeding, approaches that jointly combine information on longevity, health, and resilience will be the method of choice.",
